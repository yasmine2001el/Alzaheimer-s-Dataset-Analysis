Alzheimer's disease is a neurodegenerative disorder, meaning it is a progressive brain condition that leads to neuronal death. It is characterized by a gradual loss of memory and certain intellectual (cognitive) functions, resulting in significant impacts on daily activities. The symptoms of the disease progress over time and vary from one individual to another.

Memory impairment is the most common symptom, which must be accompanied by another cognitive dysfunction for the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease to be considered. These can include:

- Language difficulties (aphasia)
- Trouble performing certain movements or actions (apraxia)
- Loss of recognition of objects or people (agnosia)
- Impaired executive functions, meaning the inability to adapt one's behavior to a given context.
The exact causes of the disease are not identified, but ongoing research efforts are improving our understanding of the biological mechanisms involved.
