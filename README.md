## Introduction

Alzheimer's disease is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by a progressive loss of memory and cognitive functions. This analysis aims to explore the Alzheimer's disease dataset using deep learning techniques, specifically VGG16 and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).

## Dataset

The dataset used in this analysis contains images related to Alzheimer's disease. It may include MRI scans, brain images, or other relevant data. The dataset is essential for training and evaluating our deep learning models.

## Analysis Steps

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Before training the model, we preprocess the dataset, including data augmentation, normalization, and data splitting.

2. **Model Selection**: In this analysis, we use the VGG16 architecture as a pre-trained model and build a custom CNN for Alzheimer's disease classification.

3. **Training**: The models are trained using the preprocessed dataset. We monitor training progress, accuracy, and loss.

4. **Evaluation**: The trained models are evaluated on a separate test dataset to assess their performance.

5. **Results**: We present the results of our analysis, including accuracy, confusion matrices, and any relevant metrics.

6. **Discussion**: We discuss the findings and their implications for Alzheimer's disease diagnosis and research.

## How to Run

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Alzheimers-Dataset-Analysis.git
   
2. Install the required dependencies using pip or conda.

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Run the Jupyter Notebook or Python script for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
